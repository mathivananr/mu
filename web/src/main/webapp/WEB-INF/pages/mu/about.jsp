	<div class="span12 story-text">
		<p>A man, who always stand safe and secure in middle of crowd,
			born in a small town in south of south India. He had grown up with
			empty land, cattle, birds, etc. He started missing those in each
			stage of his life. During his school days, he overheard a word called
			Computer. He was fascinated about that and chose his career in that.
			Life going smoothly with his job and salary.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Sometimes his team lead informs that next week we have release,
			so we have to work in late nights and weekends. At that moment, he
			speaks furiously about karl marx, communism, globalization, America,
			blah blah with his friends, but when he get salary he forget those
			words.</p>
		<br />
		<p>One day, he saw a plant which is very familiar to him in
			childhood but couldn't recognize its name. He knows it but what made
			him to forget its name. He started thinking about how his life and
			life style changed gradually from that small town to this big city.</p>
		<br />
		<p>At first time, he reached the city for an interview, he saw the
			people crossing him in a hurry burry mode. Later, he too becomes one
			of them. Some people, speech, videos and posts make him to think
			about money, happiness, life. Then He decides let's do agriculture.</p>
		<br />
		<p>He got questions, Do you know how to do agriculture? Do you
			have money to buy land? What's minimum security? Trying to answer
			these questions, Yes he don't know how to do agriculture but he have
			confident that he will do. But for next questions are money matters.
			If he start to save money for all of these then he get old and he
			compromise himself to live same life. Again some people, speech,
			video and post reminds him that there is so many people may help each
			other in day to day life and why not they? Most of the people may
			think like him and drop their ideas because of money or some reason.</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			Now he decides to start <a title="home from story"
				href="${applicationUrl}" class="link-color">${applicationUrl}</a>,
			It will be live 180 days and in this 180 days every recharge, shopping, 
			booking your doing via this	site, he get some referral commission from 
			the merchants. He never mean that going to change the world or making 
			revolution. He want to do this and still he like computers. Let's see 
			what will going to happen after 180 days.
